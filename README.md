# Mission 3: A Markov Distinction
Computational Creativity Lab, description being "Use a Markov chain (or Markov model) to create a piece of visual art that you would find meaningful."

**System Title: Facing Markov**
Lydia Pitts

In this project, I knew the technical elements that needed to be involved -- I needed a Markov Chain and I needed visual Art. As Bowdoin's Offer of the College says, I consider "art an intimate friend," and it is something that I spend a significant ammount of time engaging with. I wanted a way to incorportate my own physical works into my system. People really fascinate me, and that is what I predominately create in my own artistic practices. This inspired you to use elements of my portraits to create a Picasso-esque, computer generated face. I love computer science, and I love doing art, but it is not often that I get to combine these two things in class. Not only was the content I chose meaningful to me, but the languages are as well. This summer I took two very short LinkedIn learning course in html and css, but I had never actually had the time to use them. It took a lot of time to re-learn the syntax and how to implement these languages. I have no idea what I want careerpath I want to follow, so to practice a little bit of full-stack work helps me learn not only what I like/don't like, but allows me to practice skills that give me the most autonomy in the future.

The challenge of multiple, and new, languages as well as applying concepts I knew to execute concepts I was learning, really pushed me as a computer scientist. It was important for me to know I understood the concept of a Markov Chain, so I hoped to explore this concept in Java -- a language familar to me. This familiarity allowed me to practice taking out a pencil and paper, drawing out a diagram and walking through the program before I started coding. This familiarity let me step away from my nervous habit of over-googling, and build good habits of really thinking through and crafting my approach. I pushed myself out of my comfort zome to create the visual represenation. It was important to me to use some skills that I struggled with before, and try something totally knew. Due to not knowing javascript, or how to extend beyond html/css, it took an imense amount of problemsolving. I know this is an area I have to improve uppon, and this is potential next steps for me (not necessarily in this class, but certainly in the future). 

Overall I was challenged in a very meaningful way throughout Mission 3!
